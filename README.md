## Abstract
As systems continue to grow in size and complexity, the task of maintaining and understand- ing the entirety of a system and its structure becomes more challenging. To address this issue, the implementation of a Model-Based Systems Engineering approach can prove beneficial. This approach simplifies the system design process by utilizing models to depict the structure and behavior of systems, which are typically represented through 2D diagrams.

The objective of this project is to investigate the transformation of current 2D system models into a 3D model format capable of capturing and representing the structure and be- havior of a system. This format served as the foundation for the development of Proteus, a 3D visualization framework. Proteus aims to provide a framework that enables the visualiza- tion of 2D system models, originating from different Modeling-Tools, in a 3D environment. System architects and developers are able to integrate Proteus into their existing projects to explore and gain new insights into their own system models.

Digital Twins, a relatively recent technology, involve the creation of virtual models that accurately represent physical entities. Proteus seeks to seamlessly integrate 3D model visu- alization within the same environment as these Digital Twins. This integration allows for the utilization of 3D models during the design and testing phases of modeled systems.
The abstract design of Proteus enabled effortless expansion of the framework. Therefore, the results of this project could be re-used beyond its own scope and offer perspective and interesting opportunities for future work.
